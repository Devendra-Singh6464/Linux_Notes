# **1. Virtual Machines (VMs)**

- Think of **VMs like separate computers** inside your real computer.
- Each VM has its **own operating system (OS)**, like Windows or Linux.
- They run on a **Hypervisor**, which is software that manages multiple VMs.
- **More resource usage** because each VM needs its own OS.
- **Example**: Running Windows and Linux on the same computer using software like VirtualBox.

# **2. Containers**

- Think of **Containers like apps** running on the same OS but isolated from each other.
- They **share the same OS kernel** but have their own runtime and libraries.
- **Lightweight and fast** because they donâ€™t need a separate OS.
- **Example**: Running multiple web applications on the same OS using Docker.

# **Main Differences**

|Feature|Virtual Machines (VMs)|Containers|
|---|---|---|
|**OS Requirement**|Each VM needs its own OS|Shares the host OS|
|**Speed**|Slower (heavier)|Faster (lighter)|
|**Resource Usage**|High (each VM has its OS)|Low (shares OS resources)|
|**Isolation**|Strong (separate OS)|Moderate (same OS, different runtime)|
